My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com),
implemented in [Roc](https://roc-lang.org) (to learn it!)

If you've watched some of
[the Roc videos](https://roc-lang.org)
and would like to try it via
[the currently-private work-in-progress compiler+docs repo](https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc),
email [roc@rtfeldman.com](mailto:roc@rtfeldman.com).
